     * The contract of a Router object.
     * 
     * By default, routes are associated with the HTTP method <code>GET</code>
     * but can be associated with one of: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE,
     * TRACE.
     * 
     * The <code>GET</code> or empty string are considered as the generic
     * <code>ANY</code> method, but if a route and/or method are not defined
     * will resolve to the special "not found" route.
     * 
     * Each mapping is connected to a function callback that can be any type of
     * functions (anonymous, method, static method, etc.), by extension such
     * function could call an event dispatch.
     * 
     * The Router support 3 types of mapping
     * <ul>
     *   <li>routes that may or may not contain keywords</li>
     *   <li>routes that are static (must be the exact path)</li>
     *   <li>routes matching custom regular expressions</li>
     * </ul>
